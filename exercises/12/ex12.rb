# Extra Credit 1: Research the difference between require and include. How are
# they different?
#
# => require() loads a module by evaluating a file. Like Perl's use() or C's include.
#
#    include() loads a mixin class's functions into the current class. Like
#    Moose's with().

# Extra Credit 2: Can you require a script that doesn't contain a library
# specifically?

#
# Not exactly sure what the question is asking. Is a library a collection of
# scripts? How are they different?

#   Hmm, that is an odd question. Just skip it, I actually am not sure 
#   what I was asking there.

# Extra Credit 3: Figure out which directories on your system Ruby will look
