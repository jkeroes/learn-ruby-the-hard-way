# => Been there, done that.

# Extra Credit 1: Change the prompt variable to something else entirely.
#
# => Tried a unicode char but ruby balked with this error: "invalid multibyte
# => char (US-ASCII)". Added an encoding comment and ruby's happy.

# Extra Credit 1: Add another argument and use it in your script.

# => done

# Extra Credit 1: Make sure you understand how I combined a <<SOMETHING style
# multi-line string with #{ } string interpolation as the last print.
#
