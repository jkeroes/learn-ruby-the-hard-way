rvm: manages ruby builds. like perlbrew. See ex 0.

    # Rebuild docs for new ruby:
    rvm docs generate
    gem install rdoc-data
    rdoc-data --install # Regenerate system docs
    gem rdoc --all --overwrite # Regenerate all gem docs


docs:
    ri ~ perldoc

booleans: true and false.

math: defaults to integer math. Append a .0 to use floats instead.

strings:
    "fmt" % vals ~ sprintf.
    + ~ .
    .chomp

loading modules:
    require ~ use
        handy: the ".rb" part of the filename isn't mandatory
    include ~ with

IO
    puts()  ~ say
    print() ~ print
    gets()  ~ <STDIN>
        * gotcha: if ARGV.first is set, then gets, by default, will open it as
          a file and read from it. Be explicit and use STDIN.gets in this
          case.
        * gotcha: doesn't handle backspace; prints ^? instead. Do I need a readline gem?

File
    .open
    .close        - flushes pending writes, too
    .read         - the full contents of the file
    .readline     - reads one line of the file
    .truncate     - empties the file
    .write(stuff) - write stuff to file
    .seek         - move within file

Heredoc:
    if the body is indented, use <<-END.
    if the body is indented and you don't want that text:
        <<-END.gsub /^\s*/, ''
    gotcha: a midstring END (ie /\SEND/) will not end the heredoc. It must be /^\s*END/.

Functions:
    def sum(x, y)
        x + y
    end

    def sum(*slurp)

q*
    %w(do re mi fa) ~ qw/do re mi fa/
