rvm: manages ruby builds. like perlbrew. See ex 0.

	# Rebuild docs for new ruby:
	rvm docs generate
	gem install rdoc-data
	rdoc-data --install # Regenerate system docs
	gem rdoc --all --overwrite # Regenerate all gem docs


docs:
	ri ~ perldoc

booleans: true and false.

math: defaults to integer math. Append a .0 to use floats instead.

strings:
	"fmt" % vals is basically sprintf.
	+ is concat.
	heredocs <<TOKEN run until /^TOKEN/. A midstring TOKEN will not end the str.

loading modules:
	require ~ Perl's use
	include ~ Moose's with

gets
	gotcha: if ARGV.first is set, then gets, by default, will open it as a file and read from it. Be explicit and use STDIN.gets in this case.

	gotcha: doesn't handle backspace; prints ^? instead. Do I need a readline gem?

File
	.close
	.read         - the full contents of the file
	.readline     - reads one line of the file.
	.truncate     - empties the file.
	.write(stuff) - write stuff to file.
